            <p>
                Hello, I'm <b>Sukanya Marati</b>, currently in second semester pursuing Masterâ€™s degree in Information Technology Management. Passionate about the world of technology and software development. I embarked on this exciting journey in the field of Information Technology Management (DAM) with an insatiable curiosity to explore and innovate.  
                </p>
    <p>
        With four years of experience in the IT industry, I bring a wealth of practical knowledge and a passion for technology to my academic journey. My professional experience has exposed me to diverse facets of IT, including system administration, database management, and software development. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but have also ignited a profound interest in the strategic aspects of technology management.        
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my professional experience, I've also delved into the world of web design and development. During my undergraduate studies, I had the opportunity to work on various web projects, including designing user interfaces, coding responsive websites, and optimizing web performance. This hands-on experience has further fueled my passion for creating compelling and user-friendly web experiences.
    </p>
    <p>            I'm excited to kick off our first lab in web page design, where we will explore the fundamental principles of web development. This lab promises to be an exciting journey into the world of HTML, CSS, and the art of crafting engaging and visually appealing web pages. I can't wait to apply my skills and collaborate with my fellow students to bring our web design visions to life.
